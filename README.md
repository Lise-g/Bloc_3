## 1/ Walmart project  

This project aims at predicting weekly sales for some Walmart stores. 

> Notebook : 'Walmart/projet_walmart_LG.ipynb'  

The goal is to reduce overfitting by using Ridge or Lasso.  

## 2/ Conversion Rate Challenge

This project aims at predicting if a web user will subscribe to a newsletter.

> Notebook : 'Conversion_rate/projet_conversion_LG_logreg7fip.ipynb'  
> Output of the notebook : 'Conversion_rate/src/conversion_data_test_predictions_Lise-model11.csv'

The conditions were similar to a kaggle competition : the model was applied to a test file with no labels and sent to our teacher.  

In this notebook, I created a baseline model. Then the model was improved with feature engineering and hyperparameters optimization. I took a look at the SMOTE-Tomek Links Method for imbalanced datasets at this webpage : https://towardsdatascience.com/imbalanced-classification-in-python-smote-tomek-links-method-6e48dfe69bbc

## 3/ Uber Pickups

This project aims at recommending hot-zones in cities at any given time of day.  
For this project we will focus on New York city and we will give hot zones per day of week.

> Notebook : 'Uber/projet_uber_LG.ipynb' 

ðŸ‘‰ All the projects have 'src' folders which contain the source files.
